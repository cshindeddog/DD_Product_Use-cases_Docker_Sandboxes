## Overview

This repository contains **Docker-based sandbox environments** for:
- **Basic setup and configuration scenarios**
- **Customer use-case and issue replication**

These sandboxes are used to quickly spin up controlled, containerized environments for testing, learning, and troubleshooting Datadog product behavior.

## Contents

- Self-contained sandbox scenarios organized by use case  
- Docker and configuration files used to simulate real environments  
- Ongoing additions as new scenarios are tested  

## Prerequisites

**Docker will be required for most of the scenarios**

All scenarios in this repository require **Docker / Docker Engine** (and Docker Compose where applicable) to run in a containerized environment.

## Usage

Clone the repository, navigate to a scenario directory, and follow the instructions provided there (typically using `docker` or `docker-compose`).

## Notes

- These sandboxes are for **experimentation and replication only**
- Not intended for production use
